# DMOJ-solutions
Original solutions for problems on dmoj.ca

All solutions AC on DMOJ but some of them are subpar/not the intended time complexity. Typically these subpar solutions will TLE in Java and other slower languages but C++ ends up cheesing these time limits.

Problems are named by their problem link on DMOJ. Certain CCC solutions are not named by their problem link on DMOJ - you will have to dig into their respective folders to find those.
