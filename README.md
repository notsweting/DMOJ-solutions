# DMOJ-solutions
Original solutions for problems on dmoj.ca

Some of these solutions are subpar - all solutions AC on DMOJ but some of them are subpar/not the intended time complexity. Typically these subpar solutions will TLE in Java and other slower languages but C++ ends up cheesing these time limits.

Problems are named by their problem link on DMOJ, apart from CCC solutions, which can be found within the appropriate folders.
